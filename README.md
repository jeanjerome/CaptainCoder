**Note: This project is currently a work in progress and is not yet finalized.**

## Description

CaptainCoder is a privacy-focused, locally-run code completion extension for VSCode that supports a wide range of popular large language models. With open-source flexibility and the integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), it provides enhanced context-aware suggestions and custom embedding models, ensuring advanced, tailored autocompletion while maintaining full control over your code and data privacy.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Code Completion:** Utilizes customizable models (Ollama, OpenAI, Mistral, Hugging Face, Anthropic, etc.) for intelligent code suggestions.
- **Privacy and Control:** Operates locally to ensure complete privacy and control over your code, made possible by local support of Ollama and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) context.
- **Open-Source and Extensible:** Fully open-source, allowing for community contributions and extensions.
- **Extensible Model Provider:** Offers support for a variety of popular large language models, both paid and open-source, allowing you to choose based on your privacy and budget preferences.
- **Context-Aware Suggestions:** Provides enhanced autocompletion with a deeper understanding of the entire codebase by supplying the model with complete code context via RAG.
- **Custom Embedding Models:** Allows users to create and use custom embedding models for specialized use cases by feeding various types of documents (e.g., PDF, web pages, Microsoft documents, Confluence pages, text files, JSON, CSV, etc.) to the models through RAG.
- **Flexible Model Switching:** Enables easy switching between different models while retaining customized enhancements and specialized functionalities, ensuring adaptability to various needs.
